# ZWHAX Valorant  Source

Original source codes of ZWHAX. I have retained the codes in their original state, refraining from any modifications. Kindly abstain from seeking my counsel in the future, pertaining to any predicaments arising from potential bans. The codes at hand are culled directly from the shell itself, encompassing imgui, esp, aimbot, loader, and driver components. For the seamless utilization of the driver, devoid of impediments, the acquisition of [Visual Studio C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/en/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&channel=Release&version=VS2022&source=VSLandingPage&passive=false&cid=2030) is imperative. I shall strive to elucidate the intricacies in the simplest manner, catering to the comprehension of novices.

**Warning**: A few times people who do not know how to compile these codes asked me for help. If you do not know how to do it, follow instructions!
